    # v4 of the gcc compiler uncovered an error in the code that should be corrected in
    # the 5.08 version of gnuchess.
    #
    # The error:
    # input.c:95: error: static declaration of ‘input_thread’ follows non-static declaration
    #
    # The patch removes 'static' from the declaration in input.c.  See msg at
    # http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-gnu-chess@gnu.org/msg00218.html

    The README file contains a manual for use:
      #{doc}/README

    This formula also downloads the additional opening book.  The opening
    book is a gzipped PGN file that can be added using gnuchess commands.
    The book_*.pgn.gz file is located in the same directory as the README.
    See the README for using the `book add' command.
