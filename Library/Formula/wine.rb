        Because Wine builds 32-bit, a 64-bit mpg123 will cause this formula to fail.
        You can get around this by doing `brew unlink mpg123` before installing Wine
        and then `brew link mpg123` afterwards.

    You may also want to get winetricks:
      brew install winetricks

    If you plan to use 3D applications, like games, you will need
    to check "Emulate a virtual desktop" in winecfg's "Graphics" tab.
