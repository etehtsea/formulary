    Now run the `android' tool to install the actual SDK stuff.
    You will have to install the platform-tools EVERY time this formula updates.
    If you want to try and fix this then see the comment in this formula.

  # The `android' tool insists on deleting /usr/local/Cellar/android-sdl/rx/platform-tools
  # and then installing the new one. So it is impossible for us to redirect
  # the SDK location to var so that the platform-tools don't have to be
  # freshly installed EVERY FUCKING time the base SDK updates.
  # My disgust at Google's ineptitude here knows NO bounds. I can only LOL.
  # And I do LOL. A lot. In Google's general direction. I can't stop LOLing.
  # In fact, I may have LOLd myself into insanity.

  # Ideas: make android a script that calls the actual android tool, but after
  # that tool exits it repairs the directory locations?
