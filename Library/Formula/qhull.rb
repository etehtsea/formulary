  def patches
    # Patch from MacPorts that makes a couple of cosmetic edits to CMakeLists.txt:
    #
    #  * The testing programs user_eg, user_eg2 and user_eg3 are no longer
    #    built and installed.
    #
    #  * The VERSION property is no longer set on the command line tools.
    #    Setting this property causes CMake to install `binname-version` along
    #    with a symlink `binname` that points to `binname-version`. This is
    #    pointless for something that is managed by a package manager.
