    coffee-script can also be installed via `npm install coffee-script`.
    This has the advantage of supporting multiple versions (of any Node libs)
    at the same time. Since coffee-script syntax changed pretty drastically
    between 0.7.2 and 0.9, you may want to install it via npm instead.

    This formula may be retired from a future version of Homebrew.
