  def caveats
    message = <<-EOS.undent
      In order for FUSE-based filesystems to work, the fuse4x kernel extension
      must be installed by the root user:

        sudo cp -rfX #{kext_prefix}/fuse4x.kext /Library/Extensions
        sudo chmod +s /Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext/Support/load_fuse4x

      If upgrading from a previous version of Fuse4x, the old kernel extension
      will need to be unloaded before performing the steps listed above. First,
      check that no FUSE-based filesystems are running:

        mount -t fuse4x

      Unmount all FUSE filesystems and then unload the kernel extension:

        sudo kextunload -b org.fuse4x.kext.fuse4x

    EOS

    # In fuse4x version 0.9.0 the kext has been moved from /System to /Library to match
    # filesystem layout convention from Apple.
    # Check if the user has fuse4x kext in the old location.
    # Remove this check Q4 2012 when it become clear that everyone migrated to 0.9.0+
    if File.exists?('/System/Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext/')
      message += <<-EOS.undent
        You have older version of fuse4x installed. Please remove it by running:

          sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/fuse4x.kext/
