     Framework JSTalk was installed to:
       #{prefix}/Frameworks/JSTalk.framework

     You may want to symlink this Framework to a standard OS X location,
     such as:
       mkdir ~/Frameworks
       ln -s "#{prefix}/Frameworks/JSTalk.framework" ~/Frameworks

    JSTalk Editor.app was installed in:
      #{prefix}

    To symlink into ~/Applications, you can do:
      brew linkapps
    EOS
  end
end
