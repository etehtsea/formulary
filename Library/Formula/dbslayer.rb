    DBSlayer depends on a MySQL client library.

    You can install this with Homebrew using:
      brew install mysql
        For MySQL server.

      brew install mysql-connector-c
        For MySQL client libraries only.

    We don't install these for you when you install this formula, as
    we don't know which datasource you intend to use.
