    # Macports patched libmikmod-3.2.0-beta2.tar.bz2 in 2004.  Most of their work
    # was merged into the upstream source by 2005 when the devs moved to sourceforge.
    # Development stopped a year later, after many more bug fixes and improvements.
    # The version was never changed. It is still called 3.2.0b2 inside their code.
    # This formula builds 3.2.0b2 from cvs, the final libmikmod at this time.

    # The patch below is the only one from Macports the devs didn't merge.  It
    # prevents a crash on accessing the samples menu in Mikmod. Check if Samples[]
    # exists before letting the subsequent code try to access the array items.

    # Also in cvs is one error that stops the build.  Below is a new patch
    # that fixes the error when linking libmikmod.dylib, where the build outputs:
    #      ld: duplicate symbol _vc_callback in .libs/virtch2.o and .libs/virtch.o
    # Problem: vc_callback is declared twice globally and once as an extern.
    # Solution: Switch it to declared once globally and twice as extern.

    # And finally in cvs the function vc_callback() is defined to use unsigned char*.
    # With this patch, virtch2.c and virtch.c will use vc_callback() identically.
