      Framework Python was installed to:

      You may want to symlink this Framework to a standard OS X location,
      such as:
          mkdir ~/Frameworks
          ln -s "#{prefix}/Frameworks/Python.framework" ~/Frameworks

      Apple's Tcl/Tk is not recommended for use with 64-bit Python.
      For more information see: http://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/

      A "distutils.cfg" has been written to:
        #{effective_lib}/python3.2/distutils
      specifing the install-scripts folder as:
        #{scripts_folder}

      If you install Python packages via "python3 setup.py install", easy_install, pip,
      any provided scripts will go into the install-scripts folder above, so you may
      want to add it to your PATH.

      Distribute has been installed, so easy_install is available.
      To update distribute itself outside of Homebrew:
          #{scripts_folder}/easy_install pip
          #{scripts_folder}/pip install --upgrade distribute
