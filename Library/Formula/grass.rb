  def caveats
    caveats = <<-EOS
GRASS is currently in a transition period with respect to GUI support.  The old
Tcl/Tk GUI cannot be built using the version of Tcl/Tk provided by OS X.  This
has the unfortunate consquence of disabling the NVIZ visualization system.  A
keg-only Tcl/Tk brew or some deep hackery of the GRASS source may be possible
ways to get around this around this.

Tcl/Tk will eventually be depreciated in GRASS 7 and this version has been built
to support the newer wxPython based GUI.  However, there is a problem as
wxWidgets does not compile as a 64 bit library on OS X which affects Snow
Leopard users.  In order to remedy this, the GRASS startup script:

    #{prefix}/grass-6.4.0/etc/Init.sh

has been modified to use the OS X system Python and to start it in 32 bit mode.

Patch to ensure 32 bit system python is used for wxWidgets
