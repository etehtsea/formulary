  def caveats; <<-EOS.undent
    Sphinx has been compiled with libstemmer support.

    Sphinx depends on either MySQL or PostreSQL as a datasource.

    You can install these with Homebrew with:
      brew install mysql
        For MySQL server.

      brew install mysql-connector-c
        For MySQL client libraries only.

      brew install postgresql
        For PostgreSQL server.

    We don't install these for you when you install this formula, as
    we don't know which datasource you intend to use.
